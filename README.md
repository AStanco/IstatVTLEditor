# IstatVTLEditor
The idea of VTL Editor, starts from the need to move in a more standardized way to define statistical rules. To reach this objective an emerging standard language VTL (Validation and Transformation Language) for defining rules, has been used. The VTL Editor it is a system designed to define and store statistical rules interacting with Istat internal metadata system. The goal of the project is to reach the following objectives: 
* The enrichment of the Istat metadata system: rules, represent metadata of process and are crucial for the information assets of a Statistical Office. Knowing how data have been treated before the dissemination can give an added value to the understandability of data and of the statistical process itself. 
* The traceability of  data: through the validation and transformation rules is possible to have a clear vision on how data have been changed during the statistical process and to move back from aggregated data to microdata. 
* The reusing of rules: when rules are defined using a common language in a metadata system it is more easy to visualize the internal validation and transformation approaches in different statistical domains, this can facilitate the sharing and reusing of rules and simplify the statisticians work. 
* The standardization: this is the “last but not least” objectives, sharing information with a common language are the fundamental keys for standardization of rules internally and externally a statistical office.
